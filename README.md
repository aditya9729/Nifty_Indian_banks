# Nifty_Indian_banks

A Project on Markowitz Portfolio Theory which helped me dive deeper into the world of finance.The basic requirement is to invest within an "efficient frontier" which can be plotted out for a given portfolio.Here our portfolio contains large capital indian banks and small capital indian banks and the problem statement is to optimize our returns by minimizing the risk in investing in stocks or volume.
